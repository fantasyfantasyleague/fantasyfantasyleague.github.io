like that water dota hero that can morph to boost different stats.
mirror image --> generate 2 clones 
muster workers to fight.
throw units around (allies or enemies)
passive that lets spears attack 2 spaces away 
passive income 
passive to protect from arrows -- some shields/items could have.
passive ricochet ranged attacks can bounce to one guy 
soul collector -- weapon collects kills and each kill adds +1 atk. Lost if dropped.
Revive back at home base w 1hp on death. Only works once.
Spongey absorb damage to adjacent tiles to protect allies.
Bouncy -- when you get combat locked you bounce away in a random direction instead. Unless surrounded.
Slippery -- immune to combat lock. 
Pack hunter -- get bonus atk for nearby allies 
Battle hunger -- more atk for nearby enemies
Passive that is like worse chain lightning, just chance to hit nearby enemy, just one enemy.
 --> but maybe it does the same dmg as the initial swing, so could be really good.



ok yeah adjust weapons: spears attack 2 spaces away, axes are more likely to lock in combat.
 Add OGRE faction and give them ability to throw enemies/allies really far.
