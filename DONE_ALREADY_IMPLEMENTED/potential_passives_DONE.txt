I would like to add passives/buffs to the game.
Traits that happen on their own and modify a unit, are not activated.
Here are the ones I would like to add:

retaliate --> chance to hit back when hit by an adjacent unit
climbing --> can move through rocks
water walking --> can move through water
haste --> add X move speed
reflect --> chance to send a projectile back towards the attacker
vampirism --> on successful hit heal 1-3 hp
resource_gathering --> can gather resources. All workers should have this passive.
poison_resistance --> immune to poison
frost_resistance --> immune to being frozen 
fire_resistance --> immune to being set on fire
magic_resistance --> reduce magic damage by 2 eg) arcane blast from elf hero
regeneration --> heal 2 per turn outside of combat instead of 1

Add them to the game and give an easy way that I can assign them to specific units or items on my own.
I want some units to innately possess some of these passives. And also to be able to bestow a passive on a unit with an item.
