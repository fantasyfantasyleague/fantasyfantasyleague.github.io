We need to add consumable items. Ie items that are gone once used.
CONSUMABLES ARE DIFFERENT FROM REGULAR ITEMS. THEY DO NOT SPAWN ON THE GROUND OR IN THE SHOP.
For now they can only spawn on Foul Beasts as bonus items (ie a foul beast might have some armor AND a healing potion)
Healing potion.
Speed potion.
Rage potion makes u better attacking for the turn
Stoneskin potion gives u stoneskin for the next turn (incl enemy's turn)

Later we will add a Refreshments Shop that holds these types of items, but not yet. For now just implement them.
