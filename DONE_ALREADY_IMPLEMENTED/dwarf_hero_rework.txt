Ok need to make dwarves more interesting.

Give runesmith new passive:
Lucky Rune --> 50% chance to not consume a consumable when it is used.

Rework Ironclad to have these abilities:
Shield Bash — Slam an adjacent enemy with your shield. Deals DEF damage (not ATK), pushes them 2 tiles, and stuns them for 1 turn. A tank that weaponizes their own tankiness.
Give him passive "Spongey" that soaks up 50% of damage to adjacent allies.
