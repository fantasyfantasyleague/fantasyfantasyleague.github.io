Ok we want to add a new way to get more items.
A shop that will be populated with random items.

The shop should appear at a random point on the map far from other players.
Eg if there are 4 players it might appear in the middle of the map.
It is okay if it is encased in resources and players have to dig to get to it.

How is it accessed? Any unit that is adjacent to it can purchase items for the player.

On the first turn, it will be populated with 5 items.
On player 1's turn, every ten turns, it will refresh and have 5 new items.

Items will cost water.
Determine appropriate item costs based on how good they seem to be in your opinion.
