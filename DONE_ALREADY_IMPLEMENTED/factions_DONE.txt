Ok we already have goblins. What else do we want?

Humans
Elves
Orcs
Dwarves

And each one should start with an appropriate hero with a different loadout based on the race.

What distinguishes each race? They will eventually have different units.
For now they can just be distinguished by:
-different stats for base units. Make it balanced but varied
-different stats/loadout for hero
-each hero should also have an ability that pertains to its faction: eg) elf hero can leap over resources at a distance of 1. So can leap over a stone wall 1 block thick and land on other side.
