Ok more consumables rework.
We need to add a set of consumables that DO spawn on the ground but are SEPARATE from the normal items that spawn on the ground.

Treasure chest (generates some gold for u) -- can spawn on ground or in beast or in vendor
Lumber pile (generates some wood for u) -- can spawn on ground or in beast or in vendor
Stone pile (generates some stone for u) -- can spawn on ground or in beast or in vendor
Water pouch (generates some water for u) -- can spawn on ground or in beast or in vendor
Potion pouch --> every 2 turns it gives the holder a healing potion.  -- only spawn in beast or vendor
Fresh fish --> heals, but less than a healing potion. -- only spawn in beast
Petroleum jelly --> 100% dodge chance for 2 turns -- only spawn in beast or vendor
Seed of God --> grow a block of trees around you -- only spawn in beast or vendor
Muscle growth serum --> + some fair amt of strength permanently -- only spawn in beast or vendor
Magic mirror --> make a copy of an item -- only spawn in beast or vendor
