//DONE//
Ok now to work on itemization.
Should be the following slots:
-head
-body
-legs
-feet
-mainhand
-offhand
-accessory

What can items do? They can either boost your stats, or give you new actions.
Right now the stats system is pretty limited. Make it so there are more stats like strength+agility+intelligence+etc.
Make them change gameplay as you see fit.
armor should also change your def stat.
Items should have a weight. Weight should affect movement. Implement as you see fit.

Initial items list seen below:
Eg) a teleportation cloak gives you an action allowing you to teleport the unit to your starting area
eg) gloves of haste: when you attack you swing twice
eg) boots of speed: make you move farther
eg) helm of constitution gives you more hp
eg) leather vest that gives you +2 agility
eg) flaming sword that gives you +1 ATK

Add a random assortment of more items as you see fit.

Players should be able to view their units' inventories and drop items on to the ground. And pick up items nearby.
