Ok replace Hoarder with Saboteur.

He will have two abilities:
Tunnel Entrance A 
Tunnel Entrance B 
They will both have separate 5 turn cooldowns.
They create tunnel entrances that let you travel from A to B instantly.
And any kobold unit can use it too.

He will also have a passive: demolitionist --> does increased damage to buildings.
He won't have the Resource Gathering passive.
