Ok I want to greatly expand the number of items and even passives or abilities that the items can bestow.

First, generate a bunch of new passives and abilities.

In each category generate 5 more items that are different than existing ones.
Give some of them passives.
Give some of them abilities.

We also need ranged magic weapons like a staff that shoots a fireball.
Or a staff that shoots a frost ray.
Or a scepter that shoots a magic blast.

Stuff like that. Be creative.
