We need more ways to keep people in combat.

Add gloves with "grab" ability that prevents unit from running away for 1 turn.
When hit in melee there should be a chance that a unit is locked in combat for 1 turn too.
Make it something reasonable.
When locked in combat, cant move away or use any movement abilities.
This includes leap, teleportation cloak, disengage, etc etc.


Halberd, spear, pike, hand axe, and shields should all increase chance to lock in combat.
Make sure the item descriptions reflect this.
And make sure players can tell when a unit is locked in combat.
