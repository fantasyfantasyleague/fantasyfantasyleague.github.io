ranged attacks and items//
update mouseover each stat to see what it does
START W BASIC ITEMS NOT FULL LOADOUT//
attack of opp stops movement and sets movement to 0 cant move//
more factions//
update hero powers --> more interesting... goblin one is dumb, dwarf one is dumb//
more items with actions
more hero types -- on game set up screen you select class?
Each hero type has unique action and stats and gear.
ohhhhh add asci art for each unit in like a side window that opens when you select them yeahhh
abilities need to cause effects with aduration. Eg) reduce def for 2 turns. Set on fire for 1 turn.
Then can turn this into item effects too eg fiery sword sets on fire.
dwarves are pretty slow
need to fix the rune_of_shatter ability --> duration instead of permanent


Add a shop that spawns somewhere where you can buy an assortment of items with water.

Fix balance --> agility is OP can get like 60% dodge.

Add more factions:
skeletons/./
trolls//
gnomes//


Not working:
opp attack from other players?//
status effects on beasts not ticking down? on players?//
ranged attack on beast should cause charge//

refine status effects and weaponst that cause them. Add more.//

Go through all heros and make them have simpler starter gear.//


ADD PASSIVES//

ADD CHAT BOX!//

update file name so it is just player-name_turn-x.json.//

How do handle weapons w actions if you unequip and then re-equip? Need to still keep track of cd.//

oohhh add healing potion system. Where healing pots are used in reaction to attack. If hp drops below x or an attack would have killed use hp potion in inventory instead.
How to get them?

Make it so that you dont start w a hero but get to choose one on first turn. THen he spawns and can move etc.//

Add more NPC enemies w diff stats. Some easier some harder.

Give units passives.

MAKE DODGING LESS OP.//

Maybe each hero should have a totally unique passive that only they have?

MORE FACTIONS:
gnomes
aquatic guys... mermen?

OK MAKE IT SO YOU CHOOSE FACTION/HERO ON YOUR FIRST TURN. 
THE HOST DOESNT HAVE TO CHOOSE.
FIRST TURN YOU CANT DO SHIT ANYWAYS...


check new factions' starting loadout. Bard starting unit should have new weapon.//

use water to spawn items?

IDEA: able to move all the windows around on the screen. And save location in local storage in browser. lol.

NEW SHOP: buy resources with water.//

Add enchantments for armor and weapons.

Make shop refresh every 7 turns.//

Dropped item decay.

Make shields have a chance to protect from arrows. Like compeltely negate lioke dodge.

convert all emojis to text variation i dont like the emojis: You add the text variation selector by placing this Unicode character immediately after the emoji:
U+FE0E (Variation Selector-15) → forces text/monochrome style
HTML code: &#65038;

SOMEDAY: animated ascii art that changes to show selected unit. So would need one for every unit lol.


ohhh add a match history board to the homescreen. I'll just hard-code the results.
